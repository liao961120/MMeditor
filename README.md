# Math/Markdown Editor

Automaticly saves markdown editing history (with [sessionStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/zh-TW/docs/Web/API/Window/sessionStorage)).

Based on [mathquill](https://github.com/mathquill/mathquill) and [markdown-js](https://github.com/evilstreak/markdown-js).

Perfectly usable locally, just [download](https://minhaskamal.github.io/DownGit/#/home?url=https://github.com/liao961120/MMeditor) this repo.
